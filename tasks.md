    **-** Change positions of the icon for user messages from the left to the right as well as lighty changing margins for user and bot messages
    **-** Optimizing hover from chat history to have the first on top to have a rounded border and background or change the z-index
    **-** Change the margin between the nav bar and the chat window
    **-** Adding the posibility of sending multiple user role messages to the chat
    **-** Make the chat unable to send messages after one was send until the response got recived
